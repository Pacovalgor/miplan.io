This Privacy Policy refers to the ways in which Appgree, S.A. (hereinafter “we” or “us”) collects, processes and uses personal information as a consequence of access to or utilization of the Appgree platform (hereinafter the “platform” or “Appgree”).

About the Appgree platform
The Appgree platform is an application administered by us and other Users (“Host”), which is used by the Host to send questions to members of a community or group of Users, whatever its size, and to collect their responses and rankings in order to establish the most widely supported proposals in record time using an innovative new algorithm (DemoRank). A Host is User who has created, and therefore administers, channels in Appgree to carry on a dialogue with other Users. The Appgree channels may allow public access by all Users (“public channels”) or may restrict access to certain groups of Users (“restricted” or “private” channels).

How we use the data we receive.

  • to provide functions and services related with your location, for example advising you when an event is going to be held close to your present whereabouts.
Who has access to your data?
Part of the information we receive about you may become known to the rest of the Users of the platform or by the Host if you participate in the channels administered by the same. For example, some information will exist which is always public for Users and the Host (such as their names and family names, and the photographs included in profiles). Under no circumstances will other confidential profile information be made public apart from your name and family name, and your profile photograph.
Other information which you decide to share with Appgree, like user Content, will also be public for all Users and where applicable for the Host by default, or at least for those Users, and where applicable the Host, participating in the same channels as you, if participation is restricted to certain Users (restricted or private channels).
When you provide us with information which is always public, or should you decide to share other information in Appgree, you permit us and the Users, including the Host where applicable, to access and use such information and to associate it with you, and it may also become known to third parties outside the platform in certain circumstances. For example, we may share information published by you in Appgree with third parties under the terms of the license you grant by means of the Appgree Conditions of Use. Likewise, the platform can deploy specific functionalities in order for both Users and Hosts to share your published content on social media and other custom applications. Furthermore, any information you publish in public or restricted channels will also be public. This means that the Host of a public or restricted channel may utilize the information outside Appgree (e.g. in websites, or radio and television programmes if the Host is a TV show, radio station, etc.), in which case third parties who are not related with Appgree may see it.
When Users download and utilize any kind of applications offered via the platform, we may share profile data with the developer, providing such data are public for other users (name and family name, etc.). If we wish to share any other kind of data with the developers of applications, we will seek your prior consent. Also, when you use a third-party application, the developer may request permission to access your content and data, including information stored on your device, and to access the content and data shared with you by other users. We require applications to respect privacy, but your agreement with the developer of the application in question will govern the way in which the application uses, stores and transmits such content and data.
Under no circumstances will other data such as the scores assigned by Users to responses be made public. Scores are always anonymous for other Users and for the Host.
We provide the information on Users to our service providers and partners, who help us provide, learn about and improve the services we offer. For example, we may use external providers to help us host, manage, administer, maintain and resolve incidents related with the platform, and to analyse data and provide search results. In any event, our service providers access said information for the sole purpose of providing with a given service, and our providers are not permitted to use the same for any other purposes and are required to recognize that they utilize your information merely as the processing entity under the agreements made with us.
