This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, and ads that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application such as Miplan. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.
When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. Despite this, you alone control and are responsible for the posting of your Tweets and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service.</br>
Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in any country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live.</br>
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please submit a request through our email <a href="mailto:info@miplan.io">info@miplan.io</a>.</br></br>

<h3 class="text-uppercase" ><font color="#53BEF8">Information Collection and Use</font></h3></br>
We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services.</br>
Basic Account Information: If you choose to create a Miplan account, you must provide us with some personal information, such as your name, username and email address. On Miplan, your name and username are always listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can create and manage multiple Miplan accounts. </br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Contact Information: </font>We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. </br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Additional Information: </font>You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and personalize your experience across our Services. We may later personalize content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts and plans for you and other users, based on your interests. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, the other service may send us information that you authorize for use in the Services. This information may enable cross-posting or otherwise help us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Plans, Following, Profile, and Other Public Information: </font>Miplan is primarily designed to help you share your interests with the world. Most of the information you provide us through Miplan is information you are asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile information such as a short biography, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the plans you create; the metadata provided with plans, such as when you create a plan; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and people you follow, plans you Like or Apply. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications: </font>We provide certain features that allow you to communicate more privately. For example, you can use Miplan messenger to have private conversations with other Miplan users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to them. When you use features like Miplan messenger to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your communications.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Location Information: </font>We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your plans, although other users will never see your exact location. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services,such as creating plans with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content such as local recommendations, ads and suggestions on people to follow.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Links: </font>We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. </br>
Using Our Services: We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services or interact with our email notifications we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications. We use Log Data to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. </br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Advertising: </font>Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Miplan. We do not use the content you share privately in Miplan messenger to serve you ads. Our Miplan Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. </br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Third-Parties and Affiliates: </font>We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Miplan users, partners (including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. Our ad partners and affiliates may share information with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Personalizing Across Your Devices:</font>When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization.</br></br>
<h3 class="text-uppercase"><font color="#53BEF8">Information Sharing and Disclosure </font></h3></br>
We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">User Consent or Direction: </font>We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. </br>
Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in differents countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our databases, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. </br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Law and Harm: </font>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Business Transfers and Affiliates: </font>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Public Information: </font>We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile information, plans, or the people you follow or that follow you. Remember: your privacy and visibility settings control whether your plans and certain profile information are made public. Other information, like your name and username, is always public on Miplan, unless you delete your account, as described below.</br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information: </font>We may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information such as the total number of times people engaged with a plan or the number of users who clicked on a particular link, the characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that people are creating plans in a particular location, or aggregated or device-level reports to advertisers about users who saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, or Miplan handle. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through partnerships with entities that may use data in their possession (including data you may have given them) to link your name, email address, or other personal information to the information we provide them. These partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so.</br></br>
<h3 class="text-uppercase"><font color="#53BEF8">Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</font></h3></br>
If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. </br>
You can also permanently delete your Miplan account. If you send us an email to <a href="mailto:accounts@miplan.io">accounts@miplan.io</a>, your account will be deactivated and deleted. When deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public profile, is not viewable on Miplan. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</br>
Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information, even after you have deleted the information from the Miplan Services or deactivated your account.</br></br>


<h3 class="text-uppercase"><font color="#53BEF8">Changes to this Policy</font></h3></br>
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="http://miplan.io/privacy">miplan.io/privacy</a>. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an Miplan update or email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</br>
Effective: January 14, 2018</br>
