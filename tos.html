<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Your Rights</font></br></br>
You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours: you own your Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).</br>
By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).

Such additional uses by Miplan, or other companies, organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.</br>
Miplan has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind.

<h3 class="text-uppercase" ><font color="#53BEF8">4. Using the Services</font></h3></br>

We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.</br>
In consideration for Miplan granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Miplan and its third-party providers and partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Miplan, its users and the public. Miplan does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</br></br>

<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Your Account</font></br></br>
You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</br>
You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them.</br></br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Your License to Use the Services</font></br></br>
Miplan gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Miplan, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</br>
The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of different countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Miplan name or any of the Miplan trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Miplan and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Miplan, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</br></br>
<font size="3" color="#53BEF8">Ending These Terms</font></br></br>
You can cancel your legal agreement with Miplan at any time by deactivating your accounts and interrupting the use of the Services. To deactivate your account, request it by sending an email to <a href="mailto:accounts@miplan.io">accounts@miplan.io</a>.</br>
     
We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI.  </br></br>
<h3 class="text-uppercase" ><font color="#53BEF8">5. Limitations of Liability</font></h3></br>
By using the Services you agree that Miplan, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents representatives, partners and licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.</br></br>

<h3 class="text-uppercase" ><font color="#53BEF8">6. General</font></h3></br>
We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at <a href="http://miplan.io/tos">miplan.io/tos</a>, will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</br>
In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Miplan’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</br>
